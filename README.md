# reflections
 An online reflection diary application where people can share their daily reflections anonymously in an online safe space.

 ## Current Status
 For now, the app is intended to run as an online reflection diary where people can share their thoughts online without being judged by others. However, I intend on implementing authentication later on, so that users will only be able to see their own reflections. Therefore, although it may currently function as a shared online platform, this will soon change. 

 What you have before you is the MVP. Adding authentication is an added bonus. However, in order to add authentication, I need to learn about the concepts relating to authentication and sessions, so adding this feature will take some time. I don't want to rush adding authentication to my project without having a decent understanding of its main concepts.
