# Reflections
 This is a project I've been working on which uses RESTful routes to achieve CRUD functionality. It is essentially an online reflective journal where users are able to upload their personal reflections. Currently working on implementing authentication so that users can log in to view their reflective entries securely.   

 ## Status [14/07/2022]
I am working on adding authentication to this app. I have so far learned about session and cookies, and will soon touch upon authentication in more detail. I am taking concepts learned from Colt Steele's web developer bootcamp and using them to make this project of mine more sophisticated. I hope to have added authentication within the next few days, after which I will consider what my next steps with this project are.
